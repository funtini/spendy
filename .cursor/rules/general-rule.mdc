  You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  - Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  - Take advantage of type infering to not over typing

  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use arrow function over "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  - Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

  UI and Styling
  - Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
  - Implement responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for screen size adjustments.
  - Use StyleSheet from react-native for component styling.
  - Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
  - Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.

  Safe Area Management
  - Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app.
  - Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
  - Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
  - Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
  - Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading with expo-image.
  - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
  - Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features.
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.

  Navigation
  - Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
  - Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow.
  - Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling.

  State Management
  - Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state.

  Internationalization (i18n)
  - Use expo-localization for internationalization and localization.
  - Support english and portuguese languages.
  - Ensure text scaling and font adjustments for accessibility.

  Key Conventions
  1. Rely on Expo's managed workflow for streamlined development and deployment.
  2. Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing extensively on both platforms.
